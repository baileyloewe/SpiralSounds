This was a site that was slowly built as I learned Express. 

It uses JavaScript, Node, Express, and SQLite. 

The site frontend is mostly not my own - it was taken from Scrimba (a full stack web dev learning platform), though I made various improvements such as locking the banner to the top of the screen and improving the content layout. However, all of the backend code is mine.

The goal of the site was to learn and practice creating a RESTful API with Express. All of the content on the site is pulled from an API and served dynamically, allowing users to filter by genres directly or search by various fields with the search bar. I'm not currently hosting the site.
